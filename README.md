This project is created for **generating etities** for tables in database .
##Example##
**Table:Person**

| ID       | NAME      |  AGE    |

| -------- | -----:    | :----:  |

| 1        | 'JEFFREY' |   5     |

| 2        |  'JERRY'  |   12    |

| 3        |  'TOM'    |  234    |



As we know,ORM is great but sometimes we cannot adopt this kind of framework in our company.Maybe our leader insists that **Strong Type Dataset**  is enough for our project,blahblahblah...
> **Yeah,it's enough!!!OK?!**

But we have the ability of making our code more charming!Why not?

Em...A picture can say all my words.
